        <h3>THE NFT PRIZES AND REDEMPTION ITEMS ARE OFFERED AND PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; WITH NO WARRANTY OR GUARANTEE BY SPONSOR OR ADMINISTRATOR OTHER THAN WHAT IS EXPRESSLY INCLUDED IN THESE OFFICIAL RULES.</h3>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>All expenses and costs not expressly listed in these Official Rules are the sole responsibility of the verified NFT Prize and Redemption Item winner. Verified NFT Prize and Redemption Item winner will be responsible for all other expenses relating to the redemption, receipt and use of the NFT Prize and Redemption Item. Until awarded, NFT Prizes and Redemption Items are nontransferable. Sponsor reserves the right in its sole discretion to substitute the NFT Prize or Redemption Item, in whole or in part, for one of equal or greater value. All federal, state, and local taxes are solely the responsibility of verified NFT Prize and Redemption Item winner. </p>
        <p>The total value of the NFT Prize and Redemption Item will not exceed the identified approximate retail value in the table above. All travel-related and other expenses not set forth herein, including but not limited to meals, ground and other transportation, parking, gratuities and incidental hotel expenses, are the sole responsibility of verified NFT Prize and Redemption Item winners. Verified NFT Prize and Redemption Item winners are each responsible for all transportation, tax, license, title fees and insurance for transportation and other related, applicable expense arising from the NFT Prize and Redemption Item. All winners, guests, or other users of redeemed NFT Prizes (<em>i.e.</em>, Redemption Items) in which an in-person event is provided, must be 18 years or older and the age of majority in their local jurisdiction, will be required to sign a release and any other Sponsor requested documents, and must be approved from a security background investigation. <br>‍</p>
        <p><strong>7. Winner Selection.</strong></p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>Approximately 2,533 randomly generated winning times will be seeded during the Sweepstakes Entry Period and the 14 days thereafter (<em>i.e.</em>, December 8, 2022 through February 2, 2023). If you are the first player to enter the Sweepstakes Code on the Sweepstakes Site at or after one of the randomly-generated winning times, the Entrant will be notified in real time on the Sweepstakes Site that he or she is a potential winner of the NFT Prize indicated. The NFT Prize will be automatically airdropped to the potential winner’s crypto wallet using the potential winner’s crypto wallet details the Entrant used to enter the Sweepstakes or to receive the NFT Prize. Odds of winning an NFT Prize or Redemption Item depends on the date/time of entry, the number of NFT Prizes remaining at the time of entry, and number of eligible entries received for each NFT Prize during the Sweepstakes Entry Period and the 14 days thereafter.<br>‍</p>
        <p><strong>8. Verification of Potential NFT Prize Winner.</strong></p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>POTENTIAL NFT PRIZE AND REDEMPTION ITEM WINNER’S ELIGIBILITY IS SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION BY SPONSOR, WHOSE DECISIONS ARE FINAL AND BINDING IN ALL MATTERS RELATED TO THE SWEEPSTAKES. </p>
        <p>Any potential NFT Prize winner or redeemer must continue to comply with all terms and conditions of these Official Rules and winning is contingent upon fulfilling all requirements. Sponsor and/or Administrator or their designees may run a background and security clearance check on any potential NFT Prize winner or redeemer. The potential NFT Prize winner and redeemer may be required to execute and return to Sponsor for its receipt within two (2) business days of notification, an Affidavit of Eligibility, Release of Liability and Publicity Release (where permitted by law) (collectively, the “Affidavit”) in order to claim his/her NFT Prize or redeem the corresponding Redemption Item. Sponsor may, but is not obligated to, exercise its rights under such Affidavit. In the event: (a) potential winner cannot be reached for whatever reason after a reasonable effort has been exerted or the potential winner notification or Affidavit is returned as undeliverable; (b) potential winner declines or cannot accept, receive or use the NFT Prize or Redemption Item for any reason; (c) of noncompliance with the above or within any of the aforesaid time periods; (d) potential winner is found to be ineligible to enter the Sweepstakes or receive the NFT Prize or Redemption Item; (e) potential winner cannot or does not comply with the Official Rules; or (f) potential winner fails to fulfill the Affidavit-related obligations, the potential NFT Prize winner shall be disqualified from the Sweepstakes and an alternate potential NFT Prize and Redemption Item winner may be selected, at Sponsor’s sole discretion, from among the other eligible entries received. Sponsor and/or Administrator reserve the right to modify the notification and Affidavit procedures in connection with the selection of alternate potential NFT Prize and Redemption Item winner, if any. Potential NFT Prize and Redemption Item winner will be contacted by email and/or phone at the email address and/or phone number used to enter the Sweepstakes. <br>‍</p>
