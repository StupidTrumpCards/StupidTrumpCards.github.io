The Terms and Conditions will be posted on the Website, and you should review the Terms and Conditions prior to using, reusing, accessing or re-accessing the Offerings. By your continued use of the Offerings, you hereby agree to comply with, and be bound by, all of the terms and conditions contained within these Terms and Conditions effective at that time. </p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p><strong>3.  Registration. </strong>You must submit the applicable registration form. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to deny access to the Offerings to anyone at any time and for any reason whatsoever.  </p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p><strong>4. Wallet, Cryptocurrency and Technology Requirements. </strong>Users shall be responsible, at all times, for obtaining and maintaining, at such users’ sole cost and expense: (a) all input/output devices or equipment (such as a computer/mobile device, up-to-date Internet browser version, modems, terminal equipment, computer equipment and software) and communications services (including, without limitation, Internet connection, a functioning an e-mail account, long distance or local telephone services) necessary to access the Offerings and for ensuring that such equipment and services are compatible with all relevant requirements; (b) functioning MetaMask or Coinbase or similar wallets (“Wallet”) capable of accessing the NFTs; and (c) any cryptocurrencies necessary to purchase and/or sell the NFTs including, where applicable, Ethereum (“ETH”). We do not guarantee the quality, speed or availability of the Internet connection associated with any mobile device and/or computer. We do not guarantee that the Offerings can be accessed: (i) on all mobile devices; (ii) through all wireless service plans; (iii) in connection with all Internet browsers; and/or (iv) in all geographical areas.

        <p><strong>You assume all risks associated with using an Internet-based cryptocurrency blockchain including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored on the blockchain and/or within your Wallet. NFTs, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology are relatively new and the regulatory landscape is unsettled. New regulation and/or new interpretations of existing regulations in the areas of securities, commodities, futures, banking, finance, currencies, trade and consumer rights in one or more jurisdictions could substantially affect the value of the Offerings as well as your rights to access, control, buy, sell or trade the Offerings. New regulations in any country or other jurisdiction could negatively impact such technologies impacting the value for your NFTs. You understand and accept all risk in that regard. Without limiting the foregoing, you assume all responsibility for any adverse effects of disruptions, devaluation, restrictions, or other issues impacting cryptocurrency platforms.</strong></p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p><strong>5. NFTs. </strong>All purchases of NFTs, as well as the terms, conditions and restrictions associated with your ownership and use of same shall at all times be subject to a separate agreement between you and us (“Owner Agreement”). A purchaser of an NFT may obtain certain ownership rights in and to the specific image depicted in the NFT as it resides on the blockchain; <em>provided, however,</em> that certain restrictions shall apply with respect to use of same, and that purchaser shall have only a limited license to the individual layered files, traits and digital works associated with same (collectively, “Digital Object(s)”). </p>
        <p><strong>NFTs are intended as collectible items for individual enjoyment only, not for investment vehicles. Please be aware that the prices of NFTs are extremely volatile, and price fluctuations in cryptocurrencies could impact the price of your NFTs both positively and negatively. We make absolutely no promise or guarantee that the NFTs will increase in value or maintain the same value as the amount you paid to purchase same. You understand and agree that the NFTs have no inherent monetary value, and they should be treated as nothing more than a collectible. No information and/or Content made available by and through the Offerings is or should be considered advice or an invitation to enter into an agreement for any investment purpose. Further, no element of the Offerings qualifies or is intended to be an offering of securities in any jurisdiction, nor does it constitute an offer or an invitation to purchase shares, securities or other financial products. It remains your sole and exclusive responsibility to assure that the purchase and sale of NFTs, and the use of cryptocurrencies, complies with laws and regulations in your jurisdiction and all applicable jurisdictions.</strong></p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p><strong>6. Items. </strong>With respect to any items that may be acquired offered or purchased by and through the Website, including without limitation NFTs, we do not warrant that the item descriptions are accurate, complete, reliable, or error free. If items are depicted on the Website, we will make every effort to display them as accurately as possible. However, there may be differences between the actual items and the depiction of same. For example, the actual colors you see may depend on your monitor/screen and other factors associated with your computer, mobile device or other device used to access the Website, as applicable, we cannot guarantee that the depiction of any color as viewed by you through your monitor/screen will be fully accurate.</p>
        <p>We reserve the right to limit awards or sales of such items, including NFTs, to any person, geographic region or jurisdiction on a case-by-case basis. All descriptions of such items are subject to change at any time, without notice, in our sole discretion. We reserve the right to discontinue any certain items at any time. Any offer for any items made on the Website is void where prohibited by law.</p>
        <p>In the event that an item is listed at an incorrect price point due to a typographical error or an error in pricing information, we reserve the right to refuse or cancel any orders placed based on an incorrect price. We shall have the right to refuse or cancel any order whether or not the order has been confirmed and whether or not the applicable user paid for such item. If a user has already paid for an item and that order is cancelled, we shall issue a credit to that user’s Payment Method (as defined below) in the amount of the subject charge.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p><strong>7. Purchases; Billing Provisions.</strong></p>
        <p>(a)  <em>NFTs</em>. Where a user wishes to obtain an NFT, upon such user agreeing to the applicable Terms and Conditions and, subsequently, connecting her/his/its Wallet to the designated area of the Website, that user’s Wallet will be immediately charged the applicable purchase fee (the “NFT Fees”). The NFT Fees are exclusive of any and all applicable taxes (including sales tax) and transactional fees required to create, send, and document the NFT transaction on the blockchain.</p>
        <p>(b) <em>General Billing Provisions</em>.<strong> </strong>All NFT Fees are payable in Cryptocurrency or USD. By making a purchase by and through the Website, you: (i) represent that you are authorized to use the Wallet that you utilized in connection therewith and that any payment information that you provide is true and accurate; and (ii) authorize us to charge the NFT Fees to your Wallet. You must promptly notify us of any changes to your Wallet. Any attempt to defraud through the use of any Wallet, regardless of the outcome, or any failure by you to honor legitimate charges or requests for payment, will result in immediate termination of your access to the Offerings (including any NFTs) and pursuit of arbitration, civil litigation and/or criminal prosecution. NFT quantities are limited.  In the event that we are unable to fulfill your NFT order due to supply limitations, you will be refunded all amounts charged to your account, which shall be your sole and exclusive remedy.<br> <strong>UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED ON THE WEBSITE AND/OR IN THE NFT TERMS AND CONDITIONS,</strong> <strong>ALL FEES ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE.</strong>  </p>
        <p>(c) <em>Electronic Signatures</em>. Authorization to bill for the Fees is obtained by way of your electronic signature or, where applicable, via physical signature and/or voice affirmation. Once an electronic signature is submitted, this electronic order constitutes an electronic letter of agency. Reliance on your electronic signature was specifically sanctioned and written into law when the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act and the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Transactions Act were enacted (collectively, the “E-Sign Act”). The E-Sign Act specifically pre-empts all state laws that recognize only paper and handwritten signatures. Pursuant to any and all applicable statutes, regulations, rules, ordinances or other laws including, without limitation, the E-Sign Act and other similar state and federal statutes, YOU HEREBY AGREE TO THE USE OF ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES, CONTRACTS, ORDERS AND OTHER RECORDS AND TO ELECTRONIC DELIVERY OF NOTICES, POLICIES AND RECORDS OF TRANSACTIONS INITIATED OR COMPLETED THROUGH THE WEBSITE OFFERINGS. Further, you hereby waive any rights and/or requirements under any statutes, regulations, rules, ordinances or other law in any jurisdiction which requires an original signature or delivery or retention of non-electronic records, or to payments or the granting of credits by other than electronic means. You acknowledge and agree that you have the ability to print or store information delivered to you electronically in a way that ensures that it remains accessible to you in unchanged form.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p><strong>8. Content.</strong></p>
        <p>(a)  <em>General Terms</em>. Subject to the Terms and Conditions, users that possess the requisite technology shall have the opportunity to view, download and/or interact with all or some of the Content made available by and through the Website and/or other Offerings. <strong>The Content shall at all times remain subject to the disclaimers set forth in the NFT Terms and Conditions.</strong> We do not control Content provided by third-party providers that is made available by and through the Offerings. Please be advised that we do not verify or fact-check statements made by third-party providers, and that the third-party providers themselves are solely responsible for the accuracy, completeness, appropriateness, safety and/or usefulness of such Content. We do not represent or warrant that the Content and other information posted by and/or through the Offerings is accurate, complete, up-to-date or appropriate. Users agree that we shall have no obligation and incur no liability to such users in connection with any Content. Users may find certain Content to be outdated, harmful, inaccurate and/or deceptive. </p>
        <p>(b) <em>Non-Endorsement</em>. The publication of any Content provided by third-party providers (including user content) by and through the Offerings does not constitute any type of endorsement of the subject third-party provider or third-party digital marketplace.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p><strong>9. Contests. </strong>From time-to-time, Contests and/or Sweepstakes may be offered on the Website. Those events, should they be offered, will be governed by a separate set of Sweepstakes Official Rules (“Sweepstakes Official Rules”) to be published separately. </p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p><strong>10. Compliance with Laws. </strong>You acknowledge that there are various rules, regulations and laws that address NFTs, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology (collectively, “Emerging Technology Laws”), and that Emerging Technology Laws may be established by each individual U.S. state, or jurisdiction and jurisdictions outside the United States. In addition to the Emerging Technology Laws, you are also subject to all municipal, state and federal laws, rules and regulations of the city and state in which you reside and from which you access the Website and its Offerings including, without limitation, U.S. export control laws, political contribution laws, anti-money laundering laws, USA Patriot Act, as amended, anti-corruption laws, and the laws of all other applicable jurisdictions (together with Emerging Technology Laws, “Applicable Law”). You agree to comply, and are solely responsible for your compliance with, all Applicable Law. <strong>You acknowledge and agree that your purchase and/or sale of NFTs and use of cryptocurrency in connection therewith is at your own risk, and we cannot be held responsible or liable if Applicable Law restricts or prohibits your access to, or ability to purchase and/or sell NFTs as more fully explained and agreed above.  </strong></p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p><strong>11. Standards of Conduct.  </strong>You warrant and represent that neither you nor any of your agents or other representatives has performed or will perform any of the following acts in connection with use of this site, any compensation paid or to be paid hereunder, any payment made or to be made hereunder, or any other transactions involving the business interests related to such use:  offer or promise to pay, or authorize the payment of, any NFT, or give or promise to give, or authorize the giving of, any services or anything else of value, either directly or through a third party, to any official or employee of a public international organization or any private entity, or of any agencies or subdivisions thereof, or of any public international organizations or governmental instrumentalities, or to any political party or official thereof or to any candidate for political office for the purpose of (i) influencing any act or decision of that person in his or her official capacity, including a decision to fail to perform his official functions with such government, instrumentalities, or private entity, (ii) inducing such person to use his influence with such government, instrumentalities, or private entity to affect or influence any act or decision thereof or (iii) securing any improper advantage.</p>

Dispute Resolution Provisions.</strong> The Terms and Conditions shall be treated as though it were executed and performed in Wilmington, Delaware and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware (without regard to conflict of law principles). <strong>The parties (and Covered Parties) hereby agree to arbitrate all claims that may arise under and/or relate to the Offerings and/or the Terms and Conditions. Without limiting the foregoing, should a dispute arise between the parties/any Covered Parties including, without limitation, any matter concerning the Offerings,</strong> <strong>the terms and conditions of the Terms and Conditions or the breach of same by any party hereto: (a) the parties/Covered Parties agree to submit their dispute for resolution by arbitration before JAMS in Delaware, in accordance with their then-current commercial arbitration rules; and (b) you agree to first commence a formal dispute proceeding by completing and submitting an Initial Dispute Notice which can be </strong>

        <p>‍</p>
        <p><strong>The Covered Party(ies) named in your Initial Dispute Notice (collectively, the “Named Parties”) may choose to provide you with a final written settlement offer after receiving your Initial Dispute Notice (“Final Settlement Offer”). If the applicable Named Party(ies) provide(s) you with a Final Settlement Offer and you do not accept it, or such Named Party(ies) cannot otherwise satisfactorily resolve your dispute and you wish to proceed, you must submit your dispute for resolution by arbitration before the JAMS office New Castle County, Delaware or, for US residents, your US county of residence, by filing a separate Demand for Arbitration. For claims of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) or less, you can choose whether the arbitration proceeds in person, by telephone or based only on submissions. If the arbitrator awards relief that is greater than the applicable Final Settlement Offer, then the Named Party(ies) will pay all filing, administration and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration and, if you retained an attorney to represent you in connection with the arbitration, the Named Party(ies) will reimburse any reasonable attorneys&#x27; fees that your attorney accrued for investigating, preparing and pursuing the claim in arbitration. Any award rendered shall be final and conclusive to the parties and a judgment thereon may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Although the Named Party(ies) may have a right to an award of attorneys&#x27; fees and expenses if Named Party(ies) prevail(s) in arbitration, the Named Party(ies) will not seek such an award from you unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous. </strong></p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p><strong>CLASS ACTION WAIVER: To the extent permitted by law, you agree that you will not bring, join or participate in any class action lawsuit as to any claim, dispute or controversy that you may have against any of the Covered Parties. You agree to the entry of injunctive relief to stop such a lawsuit or to remove you as a participant in the suit. You agree to pay the attorney&#x27;s fees and court costs that any Covered Party incurs in seeking such relief. This provision preventing you from bringing, joining or participating in class action lawsuits: (i) does not constitute a waiver of any of your rights or remedies to pursue a claim individually and not as a class action in binding arbitration as provided above; and (ii) is an independent agreement. You may opt-out of these dispute resolution provisions by providing written notice of your decision within thirty (30) days of the date that you first access the Website.</strong></p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>FOR PURPOSES OF ANY COURT PROCEEDINGS, YOU AGREE THAT ANY SUCH DISPUTE SHALL BE TRIED BEFORE A JUDGE, AND NOT A JURY, AND YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BEFORE A JURY.  THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS IS EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED AND SHALL NOT APPLY TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.</p>
